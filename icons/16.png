# Placeholder for 16x16 icon
# In a real extension, this would be a PNG file
# You can replace this with actual icon files

# To create proper icons:
# 1. Design a 128x128 icon (high resolution)
# 2. Create scaled versions: 16x16, 48x48, 128x128
# 3. Save as PNG files with transparency
# 4. Replace these placeholder files

# Icon should represent translation/language conversion
# Suggested design: Globe with "A→あ" or similar translation symbol
